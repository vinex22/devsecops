## Jenkins Server
Jenkins server is already installed, you can access the same using `Jenkins` button on the top bar. Login into the `Jenkins` server using below given credentials:

**UserName:** admin

**Password:** Adm!n321

## Gitea Server
There is also a `Gitea` server installed, which has a repository named `kubernetes-devops-security`. You will mostly be working on this repository. You can access the `Gitea` server using `Gitea` button on the top bar. Login into the same using below given credentials:

**UserName**: bob

**Password:** bob123

## Notes:
 - There is no external node has been added in the `Jenkins` server so all jobs will run on the `master` node itself, design your pipeline accordingly.
 - You might need to restart Jenkins service after installing some plugins or after making some configuration changes etc. In such case please make sure Jenkins is back up before you submit your solution.
